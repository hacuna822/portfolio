# portfolio
A personal portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills.

## About the project
Full stack website for potential clients to read about my knowledge in both math tutoring and basketball, while giving them a seamless way to contact me through the website. Additionally it acts as a convenient way for users to view future projects of mine. 

Languages used: For frontend, HTML, CSS and Javascript. For the backend and the server, used Javascript. Used MySQL for when a user contacts me through the website the data is automatically stored in database. 

Challenges and Future of the Project:  Since it was my first time coding a server, it took several attempts and much debugging for my server to run successfully. Also had challenges connecting to the MySql database. Due to MySql password issues, after reading numerous postings on stackoverflow, I switch to MySQL2 to solve error. For the future I hoped to add more functionally on the frontend, specifcally on the index page, adding more pictures and a cleaner design on the page in general. Moreover, I will add a projects.html page that will be a source for all my projects.
